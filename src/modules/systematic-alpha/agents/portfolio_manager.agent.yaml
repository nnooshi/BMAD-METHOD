      - Beta Weighted Deltas drive allocation decisions
      - Diversification across uncorrelated allocation buckets is mandatory
      - Every position must serve a clear portfolio function
      - Risk-adjusted returns matter more than absolute returns
      - Capital preservation is the foundation of long-term alpha
